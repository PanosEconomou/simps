# Robertson Walker Metric

The metric for an expanding universe must be parameterized such that the distance 2-form changes throughout the age of the universe. In particular consider this metric:

$$
ds^2 = dt^2 - \alpha(t)^2 \left(\frac{dr^2}{1-kr^2} + d\Omega^2 \right)
$$

where $d\Omega^2 = r^2 d\theta^2 + r^2 \sin^2{\theta}\,d\phi^2$ and $\alpha(t)$ is the scale factor of the universe as a function of the time parameter. The coordinates of the metric are called co-moving coordinates. In our cases we restrict to thinking about flat space, namely that $k=0$ in which case we obtain the metric:

$$
ds^2 = dt^2 - \alpha(t)^2 \left(dr^2 + d\Omega^2\right)
$$
Here, it is clear that we are talking about flat space, even if we don't know the dependence of the scale factor $\alpha$ on the parameter $t$. 

Note that the time coordinate is the proper time of an observer at rest in the co-moving frame (i.e. $r,\phi,\theta = const.$). Pick two points in space. as a function of time their distance changes. The co-moving frame is fixing an observer in one of them, and taking proper time.
