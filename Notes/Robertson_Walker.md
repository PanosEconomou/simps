# Robertson Walker Metric

The metric for an expanding universe must be parameterized such that the distance 2-form changes throughout the age of the universe. In particular consider this metric:
$$
ds^2 = dt^2 - \alpha(t)^2 \left\{\frac{dr^2}{1-kr^2} + d\Omega^2\right\}
$$
where $d\Omega^2 = r^2 d\theta^2 + r^2 \sin^2{\theta}\,d\phi^2$ and $\alpha(t)$ is the scale factor of the universe as a function of the time parameter.
